# sentimentanalysis

I built this for a Hackathon so please excuse the mess of code. I will get to cleaning it up soon. 

This code does a LIVE Sentiment Analysis on incoming tweets about any subject you add to the filter. 

Setup:
1. Add tokens to top part of file from your Twitter dev account
2. Change filter to whatever you want to comes from Twitter
3. I have also commented out the ability to save your training model. I had some issues on Hack Day with the sentiment that came out of the saved model so I commented it out and just did training on the 2kTestSet.csv before the stream started.


Changes Coming:
1. Configuration file for tokens and filters
2. Code clean up
